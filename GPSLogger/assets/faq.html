         <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
         <b>How is this different from other logging apps?</b><br />
         It's meant to be more battery efficient. A lot of other apps, such as MyTracks,
         usually go with the assumption that you have a data connection available and your
         routes won't be very long - this isn't very useful when all you want to do is log
         your position rather than marvel at it :p<br />
         <br />
         <b>It takes a long time to find a fix</b><br />
         When you go to a new location for the first time (especially after a flight), try
         running the app with 0 seconds and 0 meters so that it can find a fix by
         frequently polling.<br />
         <br />
         <b>How long can it run for?</b><br />
         I ran a few tests (0 meters and every 60 seconds) and was able to get about 12-16
         hours on a fully charged Nexus One with wifi , GPS and background data transfer
         on. Turning background data and wifi can help you squeeze out a few more hours.
         You can get best results if you put your phone into airplane mode (GPS still
         works).<br />
         <br />
         <b>I see the GPS icon active between the intervals I've set, why is
             that?</b><br />
         It's how the Android OS has implemented its GPS system. When you say you want a
         point every 60 seconds (for example), that's actually a suggestion rather than an
         imperative, and so the time interval between GPS points is never guaranteed.
         GPSLogger has logic that checks the time difference, though, and will make sure
         that at least 60 seconds have passed before logging again.<br />
         <br />
         <b>It's not accurate!</b><br />
         The accuracy is only as good as your phone's GPS chip. You may also want to check
         your environment. The inaccuracy could be due to clouds, buildings, sunspots,
         alien invasion, etc.<br />
         <br />
         <b>My time interval has passed, but no point was logged</b><br />
         The GPS will have attempted to find its location and given up after a while. It
         all comes down to your location as well as your phone hardware. If your hardware
         is weak and you were in a location with the sky not visible, it's possible that
         the app tried to find a position but simply gave up.<br />
         <br />
         <b>How do I get to the file being logged?</b><br />
         You can connect your phone to your computer and mount the SD card, then copy the
         file off. Note that while your SD card is mounted, GPSLogger can't write to the
         card, since it's in use.<br />
         If you have Astro File Explorer, then you can go to /sdcard/GPSlogger &gt; Long
         press file &gt; Open as &gt; Text &gt; File Editor<br />
         <br />
         <b>I've changed the settings, but it's still showing/using the old
             settings</b><br />
         If the app is logging, and you make changes to the settings, the changes will
         take effect <i>after</i> the next point is logged. This means that if you've set
         your interval as 1 hour, you have a long wait ahead of you. If you want the
         changes to take effect immediately, then stop logging and start it again so that
         the changes are refreshed.<br />
         <br />
         <b>What do the various settings mean? (Accuracy before logging, time interval for accuracy, etc)</b>
         <br />
         <b><i>Time before logging</i></b> - How long to wait after a point has been logged to try logging again.<br />
         <b><i>Distance before logging</i></b> - When a point is available, the app will check to ensure that this much distance exists between the previous and current points.<br />
         <b><i>Accuracy before logging</i></b> - Sometimes your phone doesn't grab accurate points due to interference (it could be within a few hundred meters which is undesirable or it could be within a few meters which is better), this setting specifies how accurate a point should be before it is logged.<br />
         <b><i>Time interval for accuracy</i></b> - When searching for a point, the app can continue searching for this many seconds and then attempt to pick the most accurate of all the points it receives.<br /><br />
