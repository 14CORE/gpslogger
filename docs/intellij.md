### Set up your Android Development Environment                                  
                                                                                 
Follow the instructions on the [Android Developer Website](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html) to set up your computer for development.
                                                                                 
### IntelliJ IDEA                                                                
                                                                                 
Download and install [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html), which is free.  I am choosing to use this instead of Eclipse.
                                                                                 
### Git                                                                          
                                                                                 
    sudo apt-get install git                                                     
                                                                                 
### Clone the repository                                                         
                                                                                 
    git clone git://github.com/mendhak/gpslogger.git                             
                                                                                 
### Maven dependencies                                                           
                                                                                 
The project comes with a pom.xml file which IntelliJ IDEA recognizes by default (it comes with an enabled Maven plugin). It will download and import the class libraries for you.
